# Event Booking App

# Overview

Implement a web application that allows users to book events from pre-defined slots in the calendar.

# Features

1) User can book for time slot

2) Calendar view should be scoped to a week where user can change the week to browse.

3) Event booking and cancellation

4) Admin can view all timeslots and see if any user signed up for it

5) API integration for event data management

6) Time slot should accept only one user. If any user already signed up for time slot, the slot should still be visible in the calendar view, but will not allow user to sign up for it
